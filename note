These command lines only upload public file (CodeBuild process) files instead of files for whole CI/CD which uploads most of project to S3.

Doesn't update 'artifacts' files.
/root
    make all          : Build loader js and css files for both dev and prod env.
                        SAME AS ./release.sh, but doesn't include latest src files.

    make sync-website : Copy local changes to a S3 bucket. Also used in AWSCodeBuild service if CFN is used.
                        Current it only sync to cr-chatbot rather than codebuild s3.
                        Example:
                            dist/,
                            src/website/,
                            src/config/aws-config.js
                            src/config/lex-web-ui-loader-config.json


Upload artifacts path and we can use CodeBuild to update lambda
/build
    ./release.sh             :  Perform a full build and copy files to /dist folder
    make                     :  Build zip files to /out folder and upload to 'ARTIFACTS'

    ./upload-bootstrap.sh    :  Upload to 'ARTIFACTS' path in S3 bucket manually. Intended for testing - use the Makefile for prod
