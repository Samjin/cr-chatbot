These command lines only upload public file (CodeBuild process) files instead of files for whole CI/CD which uploads most of project to S3.

THESE COMMANDS CREATE and UPLOAD PUBLIC APP FILES(dist folder files).
/root
    make              : Build static public files.
                        Similar to ./release.sh, but doesn't include latest src files to Artifacts folder.

    make sync-website : Only upload static UI related files to auto generated S3 from CFN.
                        Example resource files include:
                            dist/,
                            src/website/,
                            src/config/aws-config.js
                            src/config/lex-web-ui-loader-config.json


BUILD AND UPLOAD ARTIFACTS FILES. WE CAN USE CODEBUILD TO UPDATE LAMBDA
/build
    ./release.sh(optional)   :  Perform a full build including copy files to /dist folder
    make                     :  Create all zip files and upload to S3
                                1. custom-resource.zip
                                2. src.zip
                                3. templates/out/
                                4. cross-border-fees lambda function
                                For example: save fees.json, then both src.zip and custom-resource will be recreated and upload. All templates will upload to artifacts if master.yaml is saved or updated.


The only manual command that would upload Templates to artifacts, instead of select which files to update based on save/changes, it will upload everything that's prebuild locally.
Used for manual testing. Bucket is hard coded in the .sh file
/build
    ./upload-bootstrap.sh    :  build and upload all content to cr-chatbot/artifacts

INSTRUCTION FOR CREATING CLOUDFORMATION STACK.
To delete and rebuild Cloudformation, make sure to use
1. Delete Cognito unauthenticate and authenticate roles from IAM console first.
2. Create a new pool with new roles (Cognito_cr_chatbot_poolAuth_Role, Cognito_cr_chatbot_poolUnauth_Role).
2. Replace all existing cognito pool id through in the projects.
3. ./release.sh
4. ./upload-bootstrap.sh
5. Copy the last line in your command log which is S3 url for master template.
6. Use the master template URL in New template field to create Cloudformation.
7. Make sure to click a checkbox while creating CFN so it can automatically create related Roles for different services if necessary.
8. Check parent URL and see if Chatbot is working.

What is difference between saving small chunk of json data inside lambda folder vs s3 bucket?
